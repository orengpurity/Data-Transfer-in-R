### Quarto files

## Definition

# It's a mix of R scripts, the R console, and a Microsoft Word or Google Doc document

# They create a version of HTML file of the script while done and saved in the same folder

# Quarto files end with .qmd while HTML files end with .html

# Both files can be modified, saved and shared

# Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Creating a Quarto file

# click New File \> Quarto Document

# Rendering the file will create a type of output (html, word or PDF)

## Contents of Quarto files

# 1. YAML headers: always end and begin with three dashes (---) typed on its own line

# Has the title, date, type of document (HTML, Word, PDF) information after rendering

# 2. R code chunks: r codes are saved as chunk codes that starts with three back ticks (\`\`\`),

# a pair of curly braces ({}), and they always end with three more back ticks

# its an r code because of the “r” inside of the curly braces

# The hash symbol always creates comments in Quarto files when typed inside of an R code chunk

# 3. Markdown: all of the other text is called Markdown used to write comments and

# basic instructions (body)

# used to create html and CSS (cascading style sheets) sites

# everything in between the R code chunks in our Quarto files is considered markdown by Quarto

# The hash symbols create headings in the markdown language

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing

```{r}

```

## Conclusion: Quarto files bring together R code, formatted text, and media in a single file
